Lane Follower with Reinforcement Learning
=========================================

A lane-following vehicle is trained with reinforcement learning to
achieve minimal self-driving capabilities along a track. Currently it
only recognizes straight roads and left and right turns.



How to run
----------

1. Build and source the catkin package

    catkin_make
    source devel/setup.bash

2. Run the environment

    roslaunch driving_track run.launch

3. Set up a python environment for RL

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    source venv/bin/activate

4. Run the agent

    python src/qlearning.py # or
    python src/ddpg.py      # or
    python src/td3


Remarks
-------

o Q-Learning complete
  Q-learning is completely implemented. The agent trains well
  consistently and performs as desired.

o DDPG outdated
  Currently DDPG implementation is out-of-date with the utils. TD3 is
  the main focus now. Once it's finished, DDPG will be updated to
  accommodate the changes made in utils.
